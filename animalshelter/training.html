        <div><h4>Reflective Learning</h4>
As a Dog Training Instructor, of any kind whether that’s club or professional, adult dogs or puppies, we are<br>
constantly evaluating what we are doing when we are doing it.<br>
We start training an exercise and modify what we are doing depending upon the response we get from the<br>
owner & dog we are training. Sometimes we change their position, the dog’s position, the motivating force<br>
(toy, food etc.,) or the equipment used. As a Dog Training Instructor we just call that teaching, however, in<br>
the work based learning arena it’s called being a “reflective practitioner”.<br>
It is imperative that Dog Training Instructors realise that they are reflecting back; not only with the<br>
relationship they have in front of them but of past cases and dogs they’ve worked with. A dog training<br>
instructor cannot progress without this aspect of experiential learning, it would be impossible as no two<br>
owners are the same and neither are their dogs and no two will react in the same manner.<br>
Although we do it automatically, the importance of reflection in learning at work and awareness of the<br>
process, needs to be acknowledged for an individual to be able to carry out any kind of self-accreditation<br>
via the work based learning scheme.<br>
Technical and textbook knowledge, though important, is insufficient to prepare individuals to be practising<br>
professionals. Knowing how or “knowing-in-action” must also be recognised as important. Knowing-inaction<br>
is referred to tacit and intuitive, rather than explicit knowledge, learned through doing rather than in<br>
the classroom. It is the kind of knowledge that underpins much everyday activity, whether at work or not.<br>
Knowing-in-action is vital for dog training instructors, as, as we all know, ‘real’ world problems tend to be<br>
“messy” rather than well formed. Problems with dogs tend to come along in rapid succession depending<br>
upon our reaction rather than nicely organised “first solve this problem, then solve that” as is often written<br>
in dog training books. Also some problems may well be unique to that situation, in the sense that they do<br>
not fit theoretical categories and therefore do not lend themselves to the applications of rules from the<br>
profession’s theoretical knowledge base.<br>
When something untoward does happen it is likely to reflect on what’s going on in the midst of the activity<br>
itself. It is a consequence of this process that is known as “reflection-in-action” i.e., thinking about what<br>
we’re doing while we’re doing it and changing the process as we go along.<br></div>
